    <string name="HelpText">This program allows you to roll dice. It also contains macro options which allow you to roll common rolls more easily. The syntaxt for rolls is as such: type \'#d#\' for a simple roll where the first # is the number of a dice and the second is the number of sides, i.e. \'3d6\' rolls 3 six sided dice. If you want to roll more than one different die on a single roll and add these, or take one from the other you can simply put the two rolls in the form of \'#d# + #d#\' where there is a space either side of the plus or minus. The #d# can be followed by a set of modifiers in the form of a string of varying length. there must not be a space between the second # and the modifiers. These modifiers have varied effects. Some of them are listed below: h This will remove highest value of the roll, leaving all other rolls. l This will remove lowest value of of the roll, leaving all other rolls. d# This will remove the # highest values from the roll (i.e d2 will remove the 2 highest values). k# This will remove the # lowest values from the roll. ># Returns the number of die values above #. &lt;# Returns the number of die values above #. +# or -# Adds/subtracts # to the final value of the roll (it will add successes to a &gt;# feature or add # to the value of a d20 roll, for example).</string>
